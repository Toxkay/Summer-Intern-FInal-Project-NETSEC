# Summer Intern Final Project - NETSEC

Welcome to the **Summer Intern Final Project** for the NETSEC course. This repository contains a comprehensive Packet Tracer project focused on practical network security concepts and implementation.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design, configuration, and security of a simulated enterprise network using Cisco Packet Tracer. The goal is to provide hands-on experience with various network security technologies and best practices.

## Key Features

- **Zone-Based Policy Firewall (ZPF):**  
  Implementation of ZPF to segment the network and apply security policies between zones for enhanced protection.

- **Access Control Lists (ACLs):**  
  Configuration of Standard and Extended ACLs to control traffic flow and restrict unauthorized access.

- **Views:**  
  Use of CLI views to define role-based access for network administrators, ensuring proper management privileges.

- **Layered Security:**  
  Application of multi-layer security strategies, including physical, data link, network, and application layer protections.

- **Basic Configuration:**  
  Initial setup of routers, switches, and hosts, including IP addressing, hostname assignment, and interface configuration.

- **AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting):**  
  Integration of AAA services to manage user authentication and track access and configuration changes.

- **VPN (Virtual Private Network):**  
  Deployment of VPN solutions for secure remote access and site-to-site connectivity.

- **VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks):**  
  Segmentation of the network using VLANs to isolate traffic and improve security and performance.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Toxkay/Summer-Intern-FInal-Project-NETSEC.git
   ```

2. **Open the Packet Tracer File:**  
   Use Cisco Packet Tracer to open the project file and begin exploring the network topology.
## Learning Objectives

- Understand and implement core network security mechanisms
- Gain practical skills with Cisco Packet Tracer
- Learn to configure firewalls, ACLs, AAA, VPNs, and VLANs
- Explore layered security concepts and role-based access

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! Please submit pull requests or open issues for suggestions, improvements, or questions.

## How to Use

1. Open the `.pkt` file in Cisco Packet Tracer.
2. Review the network topology and configuration.
3. Explore each device's CLI for security features:
   - **ZPF**: Inspect firewall rules/zones on routers.
   - **ACLs**: View and test access restrictions.
   - **Views**: Check for role-based CLI access.
   - **Layer Security**: Observe applied security controls at different layers.
   - **AAA**: Test authentication mechanisms.
   - **VPN**: Simulate encrypted remote connections.
   - **VLANs**: See network segmentation and isolation.
